Currently, we are setting up a website for the University of Guelph's robotics team. The pages we're working on are our sponsorship page, projects page, team introduction page, and home page.
The languages used in this project are HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript (weâ€™re not entirely sure yet).
Anyone is more than welcome to help, just ask Stella.
