UPDATES: As of right now, we are close to a fully functional Subteam and Projects Template. For next steps, please see the individual teams you are a part of

Front End Devs.

- Please consult with Maya on next steps


Back End Devs. 

- comb through the site and try to understand the logic. Because of the way it's designed, this requires a lot (and I mean a lot) of tracing and thinking to set up. 
- Because the Excel is part of Back End, we are responsible for maintaining it and coordinating where everything is pulled from. REMEMBER if you shift or insert rows/columns, it messes with the counting of the variables. If you need to add more information to be pulled into the templates, try to add it to the end of the rows/columns
- For much of this, we will do things on a need to do basis (as Front End/Execs say they would like information displayed)
    - About Us
        - We need to make sure that Front End has all the information they need and can pull in tags/variables from the py script when they need it.
    - Index
        - This might be dynamic so we might have to pull many different pieces of infomation (similar to the subteams pg)
    - Project-Template
        - We need to build a base page and think about what information should be displayed on the page
        - Create the variables for the information so it can be pulled into the templates
    - Script.py
        - This file should be updated by everyone as changes in each seperate file is made. It will get messy. Please try to keep working to the functions that directly affect your work to avoid conflicts.
        - Always Test
    - Subteam Grid
        - This is mostly sorted. If Front End wantes to change things, we will get it for them
    - Subteam Template
        - This is a mess at the moment as it's being used to test cases.
        - Most of the information has been pulled into tags/variables so it will be a matter of determining if more need to be created
    - Projects-Information.xlsx
        - This is the excel doc that is currently storing the information for the website. Please take a look at the page and see how it's structured
        - After we finalize what we want the website to look like, we will have to create the individual pages for each subteam and then replicate that in the py script


Currently, we are setting up a website for the University of Guelph's robotics team. The pages we're working on are our sponsorship page, subteam page, individual subteam page, team introduction page, and home page.
The languages used in this project are HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript(in places).
Anyone is more than welcome to help, just ask Stella.
